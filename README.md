Allowance lets spenders track their purchases.

1. At first run, spenders enter the amount they have to spend each week (their “allowance”).

2. Throughout the week, spenders enter their purchases, and their allowance balance decreases.

3. The next week, any money left over is added to the weekly allowance. 

4. The allowance balance is always displayed, so spenders stay on track.
